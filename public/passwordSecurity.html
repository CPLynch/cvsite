			<h2>Quick intro to password security</h3>
			<p id='testtest'>There are many well known companies that have had there users passwords exposed, sometimes being found available on torrent sites like piratebay to the horror of their customers. Sometimes companies even store the passwords in plain text (See <a href='http://plaintextoffenders.com'><span class='underline'>plaintextoffenders.com</span></a>): that is that they are just plonked in a database like a normal string, so that anyone with access can read them. </p>

			<p>A basic level of security is encryption by a Hash function. Hashing is the use of an algorithm that processes the users password 'irreversibly' into a long unique string, that string is then stored in the database instead. Now anyone with access to the database would just see gibberish in the passwords column. There are different algorithms for Hash functions and some are better than others at coping with a brute force attack: this is where every possible password combination is tried until the correct one is reached. Md5 and Bcrypt are two examples of hashing algorithms. Md5 produces its hash much faster (it uses less computing power) than bcrypt. If someone is trying to brute force the Md5 hash they will find the password much quicker as opposed to a bcrypt hash. There is a trade of between the level of security and the amount of time it takes and number of iterations for the hash.</p>
			<p>A brute force attack can require a lot of computing power and can take a long time for hackers, because of this, instead of trying to generate a matching hash for each possible password, hackers have made databases called "Rainbow tables" which have a premade list of passwords and their corresponding hashes. Using these precomputed hashes greatly speeds up a brute force attack and in response normal hashes have been supplanted by 'Salted' hashes.</p>
			<p>Salting is the act of adding a random, user unique, string to their password before hashing. This, in effect, makes the password longer and more complicated. That often means an attack via Rainbow tables is often too time consuming and expensive for hackers because their tables are not extensive enough. A Salted hash is current best practice and bcrypt is a popular recommended algorithm to use. Alternatively, you can offload the responsibility to a third party as part of an openId, like a Google or Facebook account.</p>
